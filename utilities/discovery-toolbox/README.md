# Discovery Toolbox

> Your command center for [Microsoft Discovery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/microsoft-discovery/) — an IT DevOps–focused VS Code extension for the setup, management, and operation of the Azure infrastructure required to run the platform.

Microsoft Discovery is the AI for Science platform that enables agentic-driven scientific research and development. Discovery Toolbox provides an end-to-end deployment and management experience — including instantiation of agents, tools, models, knowledge bases (Bookshelves), and the supercomputer compute pool — plus subscription-wide resource inventory with cascade tear-down, declarative validation plans, live agent chat, and a `@discovery` chat participant for natural-language operations.

**Current version:** `v1.6.26`

---

## Install

**Requirements:** Visual Studio Code **1.95+** on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

1. Open the **[`vsix/` folder](https://github.com/microsoft/discovery/tree/main/utilities/discovery-toolbox/vsix)** and download the file with the highest version number — `DiscoveryToolbox-v<version>.vsix`.
2. In VS Code, open the Command Palette (**`Ctrl+Shift+P`** / **`Cmd+Shift+P`**) and run **`Extensions: Install from VSIX…`**, then pick the file you downloaded.
3. Reload VS Code when prompted, then click the **Discovery Toolbox** icon in the Activity Bar to open the **Welcome** page. From there, jump into the **Onboarding Journey** for a guided walk-through.

> **Updating.** The toolbox checks for new releases on activation and shows a banner on the Welcome page. Click **Install Now** to upgrade in place, or repeat the steps above with a newer `.vsix`.

## What Discovery Toolbox does

- 🔧 **End-to-end deployment** — Provision the full Microsoft Discovery platform from scratch (VNets, supercomputers, workspaces, projects, chat models, storage, managed identities) using a bundled, hardened Bicep template, deployed directly from inside VS Code with live terminal output.
- 🤖 **Agent & tool publishing** — Publish AI agents and containerized tools directly to your Discovery environment. Create from scratch or from the catalog, then build tool images **remotely via ACR Tasks** — no local Docker required — and push them straight to your Azure Container Registry.
- 🛡️ **Prerequisite validation** — Automatically verify 100+ Azure prerequisites — RBAC roles, resource providers, quotas, policies, **network security perimeter**, and configuration — before deployment, with one-click remediation actions for every issue found.
- 🗂️ **Inventory & cleanup** — Subscription-wide scan of every Discovery resource group, workspace, project, agent, supercomputer, storage account/container, UAMI, Bookshelf, ACR registry, and orphan MRG. Per-leaf delete and full project / workspace / supercomputer cascade tear-down with type-confirm modals (gated by `mdToolbox.enableCleanup`).
- 📊 **Architecture visualization** — See your entire Discovery deployment topology as an interactive diagram (workspaces, projects, agents, supercomputers, storage, networking) with real-time health status. Export as PNG (2×) or SVG, or browse a built-in example dataset.
- 💰 **Cost analysis** — Track per-resource costs across your Discovery resource groups (daily, weekly, monthly breakdowns). Sortable table with RG and service filters, plus direct links to the Azure Portal cost blade.
- 📋 **Operational monitoring** — 5-signal diagnostics dashboard (Resource Health, Active Alerts, Advisor Recommendations, Service Health, Diagnostic Settings) across main and managed resource groups, with KPI tiles.
- 📜 **Operations History** — Per-resource CRUD audit log of every create and delete the toolbox performs, persisted to global state and filterable by op type, target, RG, region, and status.

## Key capabilities

- **Onboarding Journey** — Guided 6-step path (Discover → Evaluate → Engage → Triage → Onboard → Deploy & Build) with curated links to the Azure announcement, MS Learn docs, and solutions page.
- **Dashboard** — At-a-glance health of every section with colored status tiles, KPI/hybrid metric tiles, and completion tracking.
- **Operations Summary** — One pane for live deploy / teardown / validation runs, a past-run history selector, and an editable plan the `@discovery` participant executes.
- **Starter Kits** — One-click deploy of official Microsoft Discovery starter kits (curated domain agent bundles — chemistry, silicon, life sciences, physics) from the public `microsoft/discovery` registry, in a gallery page or in chat.
- **Tenant & Subscription Switcher** — Switch the toolbox's target by picking a tenant, then a subscription under it, or find a subscription's owning tenant from just its id.
- **Guided Quota Requests** — A quota-request builder that pre-checks the required resource providers (a model-quota request stalls until Microsoft.CognitiveServices is registered), offers one-click registration, and drives a semi-automated portal form filler.
- **Chat Capabilities & Help** — `@discovery /help` lists what the participant can do; a Dashboard capabilities card surfaces the same catalog plus a live inventory of the `#discovery_*` tools.
- **Prerequisites** — Azure CLI, Bicep, login, tenant, subscription, region — including approved-region validation against the Azure locations API.
- **Deployment Settings** — Region + resource group selectors that act as both the deployment target for new infrastructure and the management scope used to discover existing deployments.
- **Permission Auditing** — Enumerate 15 RBAC roles with member resolution (users, groups, service principals, managed identities) across subscription, RG, and child-resource scopes.
- **Role Summary** — 3-persona capability matrix (Platform Admin · Scientist · Reader) showing what each persona can and can't do based on current role assignments.
- **Quota Management** — vCPU and AI Foundry TPM quotas per region with one-click quota-form data generation; NetApp Files reported informationally.
- **Network Security** — Four checks for the AIFSPInfrastructure service principal (existence, NSP Perimeter Joiner role, role assignment, Reader at subscription scope) with one-click create/assign actions.
- **Bicep Deployment** — Validate, configure, and deploy the bundled template with real-time terminal output and a live Infra Status bar.
- **Inventory** — Subscription-wide scan of every Discovery resource group, workspace, project, agent, supercomputer, storage account, container, UAMI, ACR, MRG, and Bookshelf — with inline per-leaf delete and cascade tear-down (project / workspace / supercomputer) when `mdToolbox.enableCleanup` is on.
- **Agents Page** — Combined catalog browser + agent inventory across workspaces and projects with model, tools, KBs, and Studio/Foundry links.
- **Tool Publishing** — End-to-end ACR build & push pipeline via ACR Tasks (no local Docker required), with image verification and ARM deploy.
- **Agent Publishing** — Create agents from scratch or catalog with 8-phase deploy progress events and retry on failure.
- **Architecture Export** — Export your deployment topology as PNG (2×) or SVG; Show Example mode with realistic sample data.
- **Cost Analysis** — Per-RG cost queries with daily/weekly/monthly breakdowns, RG and service filters.
- **Diagnostics** — 5 signals with 6 KPI tiles and 5 collapsible data tables across main + managed resource groups.
- **Cleanup** — All-or-nothing destructive teardown of every Discovery resource in scope, double-confirmed by typing the RG name. Off by default; flip `mdToolbox.enableCleanup` to enable.
- **Tracking Log** — Azure Activity Log viewer with date range presets, search, sort, and expandable detail rows.
- **Operations History** — Per-resource CRUD log of every create/delete the toolbox performs (workspace, chat model, project, storage, UAMI, agent, MRG, Bookshelf, ACR registry, ACR image), persisted to global state and filterable by op type, target, RG, region, and status.
- **Activity Log** — Every Azure API call routed through a logged fetch wrapper for full traceability and troubleshooting.
- **Documentation** — Embedded MS Learn docs browser (no git clone required).
- **Sidebar Health Overlays** — Per-section busy and error icons in the Activity Bar tree, gated by `mdToolbox.sidebar.showBusyOverlay` / `showErrorOverlay`.
- **Update Checker** — Automatic version check on startup with a welcome-page banner and VS Code notification when a new version is available.

## What's new & coming soon

Experimental features are off by default. To opt in, set `mdToolbox.showExperimental` to `true` in VS Code Settings. The pages exist and are functional — they're hidden from the sidebar until the toggle flips.

| Status | Feature | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Experimental | **Plan-Driven Validation** | Author a declarative 7-stage build plan (workspace · chat model · storage · project · agents · interactions), execute it, and review per-step pass/fail with JSONL audit footers. Stage 6 supports a multi-substep composer (`createInvestigation` · `addTask` · `addConversation` · `addMessage`) so a single plan can stand up a project, deploy agents, and assert on chat responses end-to-end. Failed runs offer a one-click cleanup of every resource the run created. |
| Experimental | **Live Agent Chat** | Talk to deployed Discovery agents from a 3-pane chat UX (investigations · conversations · messages) over REST or MCP, with a four-mode transport selector (`rest-only` · `mcp-only` · `rest-then-mcp` · `mcp-then-rest`) and per-message override. Conversations persist as JSONL under `~/.md-toolbox/conversations/`. |
| Experimental | **Agent Scorecard** | LLM-as-judge per-agent scoring page tied to validation runs, with pass/fail rubrics and per-rubric drill-down. |
| Experimental | **Bookshelves & Knowledge Bases** | Bookshelf enumeration, deploy form, and per-resource delete — wired into the Agent Deploy form's Knowledge Bases multi-select, the Inventory page, and the architecture diagram. |
| Experimental | **Supercomputer Page** | AKS snapshot of the Discovery supercomputer with node pool list, resize/delete/create actions, and a read-only kubectl console. |
| Experimental | **MCP Catalog & Invoke** | Browse MCP servers exposed by your Discovery environment and invoke their tools directly from the toolbox. |
| Experimental | **@discovery Chat Participant** | Slash commands (`/help`, `/setup`, `/deploy`, `/list`, `/create-agent`, `/explain`) plus the full `#discovery_*` language model tool set — read tools (capabilities, catalog, starter kits, agents, tenants & subscriptions, docs, config, environment checks & preflight, Operations Summary plan) and write tools (`discovery_deployBicep` · `discovery_deployTool` · `discovery_deployAgent` · `discovery_provisionFoundation` · `discovery_applySetting` · `discovery_modifyNodePool`) for natural-language agent creation, infrastructure deploys, and Q&A. Write tools are double-gated on `mdToolbox.advancedDevProxy.allowDeploys` plus per-action approval flags. Requires GitHub Copilot Chat. |
| Planned | **Post-Deploy Health Smoke** | Dashboard-level passive health verification, endpoint connectivity tests, and Service Health correlation — complements the active Validation feature. |
| Planned | **Centralized Input Validation** | Shared validation rules driving inline validation across every editable field. |
