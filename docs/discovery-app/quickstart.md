# Microsoft Discovery: Quick Start Guide 🧪

> **Your first 15 minutes with Microsoft Discovery** — zero cloud, zero IT ticket, all hands-on.

---

## What is Microsoft Discovery?

Microsoft Discovery is the AI-augmented science and engineering platform, offered as the **Microsoft Discovery app** (a local-first  client this Quick Start covers) and **Microsoft Discovery services** (cloud-hosted, [documented on Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/microsoft-discovery/)). Install the app on your laptop and you immediately have:

- 📚 **A searchable knowledge base** of your own papers, docs, and code (Bookshelf)
- 🔧 **Curated scientific tools** ready to deploy to GitHub Copilot, Claude, or Cursor (Tool Catalog)
- 📋 **A task graph** that captures the real, hierarchical shape of research work (Tasks)
- 🤖 **Autonomous agents** that run multi-step research in the background (Discovery Engines)
- 📓 **A lab notebook** for collecting, organizing, and publishing findings (Notebook)
- ⌨️ **A CLI** that exposes every capability for scripts and automation (`dx`)

You don't need an Azure subscription. You don't need cloud credentials. Everything runs on your machine.

## The 5-Minute Concept Map

Before you click anything, here's how Microsoft Discovery is organized:

```
📁 Your workspace folder (any folder you choose)
 └── 📂 .discovery/        ← all Microsoft Discovery state lives here, version-controllable
      ├── config.json       ← engines, models, providers
      ├── bookshelves/      ← indexed knowledge
      ├── tasks/            ← task graph (DAG)
      ├── notebooks/        ← findings and write-ups
      └── engines/          ← Discovery Engine state
```

| Concept | Real-World Analogy | What It Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Workspace** | Your lab notebook drawer | Any folder on disk. Microsoft Discovery keeps its state in `.discovery/` inside it. |
| **Lab Notebooks** 📓 | Your bench journal | Where you collect findings, decisions, and hypotheses, and publish them as wiki pages, briefs, or papers. |
| **Bookshelf** 📚 | A smart filing cabinet that reads every paper inside it | Ingests text-based formats such as PDFs, Markdown, Office formats, and code. Indexes it for semantic, keyword, and graph search. |
| **Tool Catalog** 🔧 | A plug-in panel of scientific instruments | Curated MCP servers (PubMed, RCSB PDB, arXiv, etc.) you can deploy to your AI assistants in one click. |
| **Tasks** 📋 | The whiteboard plan for the project | A directed-acyclic graph of work items with explicit dependencies, status, and ownership. Not a flat to-do list. |
| **Purpose** 💫| A grading rubric | A structured statement of intent that is used to capture why a Task exists and to measure how closely a Task's output fulfils that intent. |
| **Engines** 🛞 | A tireless junior researcher | A long-running autonomous agent that uses your bookshelves, agents, and tools to make multi-step progress. |
| **Agents**  🤖 | A specialist hired for a specific job | A purpose-built composition of capabilities packaged as a reusable .agent.md file which can invoked in Discovery. |
| **Dependencies** ✅| A pre-flight checklist | The SDK layer that manages the external runtime components that Discovery needs to function. |
| **`dx` CLI** ⌨️ | The keyboard shortcut to everything | The same SDK as the extension, exposed as a command-line tool for scripts and automation. |

## Step 0: Install Microsoft Discovery 💾

Download the installer from the latest release and run it. That's it.

👉 **[Download the latest Microsoft Discovery installer](/README.md)** — pick the `Discovery-app-<version>-<release>-<platform>-<arch>.<installer-type>` asset.

> ⚠️ **Prerequisites.** Windows 11 or macOS (Arm64) and an active **GitHub Copilot subscription**. Microsoft Discovery is a self-contained desktop applicaton. See [install.md](install.md) for the full list of prerequisites and installation steps.

---

## Step 1: Tour the Discovery experience

Select the **Discovery** action button from the sidebar and the pane opens with collapsible panes. Here's what you'll see:

![Screenshot detail of the left action bar and the Discovery icon highlighted in red](/includes/media/discovery-action-detail.png)

### Project
The Project pane lists the file assets for the current project scope only, in the familiar Explorer hierarchical, drop-down format.

### Lab Notebooks
Create a Jupyter, Markdown, or Team Wiki notebook to capture findings and save within a project. Discovery can use these notebooks and you can add to them.

### Bookshelf
A GraphRAG-based knowledge base that is local to your project. Use the Bookshelf to keep indexes of your documents, manuals, papers, and other assets. Discovery can reference the Bookshelf to assist in your research.

### Tools
A list of ready-to-use tools that ships with Discovery initially populates this list. You can add or author your own and Discovery will use them when processing your tasks.

### Tasks
A hierarchical list of tasks that the Discovery Engine creates to systematically decompose your user prompt or goal to completion.

### Purpose
Optional objective or guiding terminal state to align tasks.

### Engines
Engines are the processing capability of Discovery. Discovery ships with two default engines, *Mission Control* and *Generic Copilot*. Both use the `copilot-cli`.

### Agents
Agents that you can add to Discovery for managing workloads. Discovery ships with a few basic, general-purpose agents

### Dependencies
The dependency pane lists the dependencies that Discovery uses to run. Discovery currently ships with four dependencies:
  * Clio Copilot plugin which powers your Engines
  * GraphRAG Zero runtime for knowledge indexing
  * Doc-cracker OCR runtime, an optical character recognition package that allows Bookshelf to include scanned documents and images; and,
  * ONNX embedding model, from Hugging Face

A few things to know:

- **Checkboxes** next to a Bookshelf or Tool Catalog source toggle whether it's exposed to GitHub Copilot. Tick the box, and Copilot can use it as a tool. Untick it, and Copilot can't.
- **Health dots** (green / yellow / red) show whether a provider or source is reachable.
- **Right-click any item** to open the context menus and see what you can do with it.

---

## Step 2: Create a Workspace

1. In the **Workspace** panel, click **Create a new Workspace**.
2. Select any folder to store your Discovery Express assets.
3. Wait for all dependencies to finish installing; each dependency will show a progress bar as it loads.

---

## Step 3: Build Your First Bookshelf 📚

A Bookshelf is a local, searchable index of your documents.

### Create a Bookshelf

1. In the **Bookshelf** panel, click the **+** button.
2. Name it something memorable, like `MyResearchPapers`.
3. Choose a provider if prompted. The provider is the algorithm used to read, index, and search your documents. The default is fine for now.

### Ingest some documents

1. Right-click the new shelf and choose **Ingest Documents**.
2. Pick two or more individual files or a folder of text-based files such as PDFs, Markdown, Office formats, or code.
3. Wait. Indexing happens in the background; the shelf shows progress as it goes.

> 🔖 **Remember.** Microsoft Discovery ships with a **bundled local embedding model** (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` ONNX). Semantic search works **immediately, offline, with no API key**. If you have an Azure OpenAI key configured, Microsoft Discovery uses that instead for higher quality — but you don't have to.

### Confirm it worked

When ingestion finishes, the shelf shows a document count and a green health dot. You now have a domain-aware index of your own content.

> 💡 **Try this now.** Create a shelf called `QuickStart` and ingest a folder of papers or notes you actually use. Even a few PDFs is enough to test with.

---

## Step 4: Ask Copilot About Your Stuff 💬

Now let's make Copilot use the shelf you just built.

1. **Tick the checkbox** next to your new shelf in the Bookshelf panel. That exposes it to GitHub Copilot as a tool.
2. **Open Copilot Chat** (`Ctrl+Alt+I` on Windows, or click the chat icon).
3. **Ask a domain question** that depends on the documents you ingested:

```
What are the key findings on protein folding in my Quick Start shelf?
```

Copilot will pick up your bookshelf as a tool, search it, and respond **with citations** that point back into your documents.

> 💡 **Try this now.** Tick your shelf's checkbox and ask Copilot a question that only your ingested papers can answer. The citations are the proof.

---

## Step 5: Pull in Scientific Tools 🔧

Microsoft Discovery's **Agent Plugin Marketplace** has 8 curated, free MCP servers across 3 scientific disciplines, all backed by major scientific organizations.

| Category | Plugins |
| --- | --- |
| **Biomedical & Life Sciences** 🧬 | BioMCP (PubMed + clinical trials), RCSB PDB (protein structures), UniProt (protein sequences), NCBI Entrez (gene / protein / nucleotide databases) |
| **Physical Sciences & Engineering** ⚛️ | NASA PDS (planetary data), OPTIMADE (crystal structures, materials science) |
| **Scientific Literature & Search** 📄 | arXiv (preprints), bioRxiv / medRxiv (biology and medical preprints) |

### Add the marketplace

The Agent Plugin Marketplace is a Git repository of plugin manifests. Add its URL to your VS Code user settings:

```jsonc
// settings.json
"chat.plugins.marketplaces": [
  // Agent Plugin Marketplace URL
]
```

### Enable a plugin

Open the **Agent Plugins** panel in VS Code, find a plugin, and toggle it on. VS Code's native plugin host handles the rest — start, stop, reconnect, all automatic. The plugin is immediately available in Copilot Chat.

> ⚠️ **Watch out.** Most of these MCP servers call live external APIs, so they need internet access at query time even though Microsoft Discovery itself runs locally.
>
> 💡 **Try this now.** Enable **arXiv** and ask Copilot Chat: `Find recent arXiv papers on diffusion models for protein design.`

---

## Step 6: Plan Work with Tasks 📋

Tasks in Microsoft Discovery are not a flat checklist. They're a **directed-acyclic graph** with explicit dependencies, a real status state machine, and queries like "what's ready to work on?" and "what's blocked?".

### The status state machine (in plain English)

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `new` | Created, not started |
| `executing` | Actively in progress |
| `executionDone` | Work is finished, awaiting verification |
| `complete` | Verified done |
| `onHold` | Paused intentionally |
| `failed` | Tried, didn't work |
| `incomplete` | Started but won't be finished |
| `stale` | Untouched too long |
| `flaggedHuman` / `flaggedAi` | Needs attention from a person or an AI |
| `removed` | Soft-deleted |

> 🔖 **Remember.** Status names are exact. `done`, `in-progress`, `closed`, and `pending` are **not** valid — the system rejects them. Use the values above.

### Create your first task graph

Open Copilot Chat and ask it to break a real research plan down for you:

```
Use the tasks tool to plan a 5-step literature review on solid-state battery cathodes.
Create a parent task and 5 dependent sub-tasks.
```

Copilot will create the parent task, the children, and the dependency edges. Open the **Tasks** panel and watch them appear.

### Find what's ready

Ask Copilot:

```
What tasks are ready to work on right now?
```

A task is **ready** when all its dependencies are `complete` or `executionDone`. **Blocked** is the opposite. These are first-class queries in the Tasks tool — not something you have to compute by hand.

> 💡 **Try this now.** Ask Copilot to plan a 3-step task graph for a real piece of work you have this week, then ask it which task is ready first.

---

## Step 7: Start a Discovery Engine 🤖

A **Discovery Engine** is a long-running agent that uses your Microsoft Discovery tools to make multi-step progress. Engines are great for jobs you'd hand to a careful intern — "go scan these papers and summarize anything new about X," "watch this folder and triage incoming results."

### Autonomy levels

| Level | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| **Full** | The engine uses any of its allowed tools without asking. |
| **Supervised** | The engine proposes each tool call and waits for your approval. **This is the right setting for your first run.** |
| **Locked** | The engine can only use a strict whitelist of tools. |

### Configure an engine

Engines are defined in `.discovery/config.json` under `cognition.engines`. The two production-ready adapters are **`copilot-cli`** (drives GitHub Copilot CLI) and **`clio`** (CLIO's reasoning engine).

```jsonc
{
  "cognition": {
    "engines": [
      {
        "definitionId": "research-sweep",
        "displayName": "Research Sweep",
        "adapterKind": "copilot-cli",
        "systemPrompt": "Search bookshelves, synthesize findings, produce a summary.",
        "policy": { "level": "Supervised" }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Start it

Two equivalent ways:

- **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) → `Microsoft Discovery: Start Engine` → pick `research-sweep`.
- **Copilot Chat**: `Start the research-sweep engine and analyze my Quick Start shelf.`

In Supervised mode, a dialog appears for each proposed action; you approve or deny it. You can pause, resume, or stop the engine from the **Engines** panel at any time.

> ⚠️ **Watch out.** Don't run a brand-new engine in `Full` mode against tools that mutate external systems. Use `Supervised` until you trust both the prompt and the tools.
>
> 💡 **Try this now.** Add the snippet above to your `.discovery/config.json`, start the engine in Supervised mode, and approve a few actions to see how it works.

---

## Step 8: Capture Findings in a Notebook 📓

A Notebook is where research **content** lives — findings, decisions, hypotheses, and write-ups. Microsoft Discovery supports three formats; you pick the one that fits how you work.

| Format | When to use it | What it looks like |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Jupyter** | Personal lab journal; mixing notes and executable cells; chronological log | A single notebook file in the VS Code notebook editor. Drag content from chat into typed cells (Finding, Decision, Hypothesis…). |
| **Wiki** | Team-shared project knowledge; themed pages anyone can browse | A folder of `.md` files (`decisions.md`, `findings.md`, `notes.md`) you edit directly. |
| **Brief** | Executive summary that auto-updates as work progresses | A single `brief.md` the system proposes updates to; you accept or reject. |

### Create a notebook

- **In Copilot Chat**: `Create a wiki notebook called Catalyst Study.`
- **In the sidebar**: open the **Notebooks** panel, click **+**, choose a format, name it.

### Add content to it

You have several options, all equivalent:

- Type directly into the file (Wiki / Brief) or notebook editor (Jupyter).
- Pin a result from a Bookshelf search.
- Paste into Copilot Chat: `Save this to my notebook: [paste your text]`.
- Drop files into the notebook's sources folder; they're picked up on the next session.

### Publish

Any notebook can be rendered to a shareable format:

```
Render my Catalyst Study notebook as LaTeX.
```

Wiki pages, LaTeX, and PowerPoint outlines are supported today.

> 🔖 **Remember.** Everything in `.discovery/` is plain files on disk. You can `git init` your workspace folder and version-control your bookshelves, tasks, and notebooks just like code.
>
> 💡 **Try this now.** Ask Copilot Chat to create a Wiki notebook for the project you're working on, then save your last interesting Bookshelf answer to it.

## Step 9: Drive Everything from the dx CLI (Optional) ⌨️

If you'd rather type than click — or you're scripting a pipeline — the `dx` CLI exposes the same SDK as the extension.

### Bootstrap a workspace

```powershell
dx init --workspace C:\work\my-project
dx doctor --workspace C:\work\my-project
```

### Bookshelf from the CLI

```powershell
dx bookshelf create papers --workspace C:\work\my-project
dx bookshelf ingest <shelf-id> C:\papers --recursive --workspace C:\work\my-project
dx bookshelf search <shelf-id> "battery electrolyte stability" --workspace C:\work\my-project
dx bookshelf ask "What are the main failure modes?" --shelf <shelf-id> --sources --workspace C:\work\my-project
```

### Tasks, Tool Catalog, and Engines

```powershell
dx task create "Review new catalyst results" --priority 2 --workspace C:\work\my-project
dx task graph --workspace C:\work\my-project --output json

dx catalog list --workspace C:\work\my-project
dx catalog add-mcp "Microsoft Learn" https://example.com/mcp --transport http --workspace C:\work\my-project

dx engine list-definitions --workspace C:\work\my-project
dx engine routing-snapshot --workspace C:\work\my-project
```

### Configure your model

```powershell
dx workspace config llm show --workspace C:\work\my-project
dx workspace config llm test --workspace C:\work\my-project
```

> 💡 **Try this now.** Run `dx doctor --workspace .` from your project folder and read the output. It tells you exactly which capabilities are ready to go.

## Key Takeaways

| # | Lesson |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | **Local-first.** Your data, your indices, your tasks, your notebooks — all on your machine, all version-controllable. |
| 2 | **Three surfaces, one SDK.** The VS Code extension, the `dx` CLI, and your AI assistant all talk to the same engine. Switch surfaces freely. |
| 3 | **Bookshelf + Copilot is the wow moment.** Domain-aware AI for your own documents in seconds, with no API keys. |
| 4 | **Tasks are a graph, not a list.** Dependencies are first-class, status is a state machine, and "ready" is a query. |
| 5 | **Supervised first.** Run new engines in Supervised mode until you trust both the prompt and the tools they touch. |

---

## Next Steps 🚀

You've got the basics. Here's where to go deeper.

### Customize a Bookshelf provider

Each shelf has exactly one active provider. The default works out of the box, but you can switch a shelf to a different provider (e.g. Azure AI Search) for higher-quality retrieval over very large corpora.

### Build a multi-step Task graph

Hand-craft a task DAG with real dependencies for a piece of work you actually own this week. Use `dx task dep add` to wire the edges, then ask Copilot which task is ready first.

### Author your own Discovery Engine

Define a custom engine in `.discovery/config.json` with your own system prompt, autonomy policy, and per-tool rules.

### Share what you build

Share your workflows, prompts, and plugins in [Discussions](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/category/azure/discussions/microsoft-discovery-discussions). If you'd like to land an agent or starter kit in this catalog, see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the authoring guides under [`docs/authoring-guides/`](../authoring-guides/).

### Pair with Microsoft Discovery services for team scale

When your work outgrows a single laptop, your bookshelves, tools, and workflows carry forward into [Microsoft Discovery services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/microsoft-discovery/) — the cloud-hosted, enterprise-scale platform — without starting over.

## Glossary

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| **Bookshelf** | A local, multi-strategy (vector / keyword / graph) index of documents you've ingested. |
| **Provider** | The backend a Bookshelf uses for indexing and search. Each shelf has exactly one. |
| **MCP** | **Model Context Protocol** — the standard interface AI assistants use to call external tools. Microsoft Discovery exposes its capabilities as MCP tools. |
| **Agent Plugin** | A VS Code-standard manifest (`agent-plugin.json`) that wires up an MCP server as a Copilot tool. The marketplace is a Git repo of these. |
| **RAG** | **Retrieval-Augmented Generation** — the pattern where an AI searches a knowledge base, then uses what it finds to answer. Bookshelf is RAG for your own docs. |
| **Embedding** | A numeric fingerprint of text used for semantic search. Microsoft Discovery uses a bundled local ONNX model by default. |
| **ONNX** | An open format for ML models. The bundled embedding model runs locally as ONNX so semantic search works offline. |
| **Engine / Adapter** | A Discovery Engine is the agent; the **adapter** is the runtime it talks to. Production adapters today are `copilot-cli` and `clio`. |
| **Autonomy policy** | The rule set that controls what tools an engine can use — `Full`, `Supervised`, or `Locked`. |
| **DAG** | **Directed Acyclic Graph** — the shape of the Tasks tree. Edges are explicit dependencies, not implicit ordering. |
| **`.discovery/`** | The folder inside your workspace where Microsoft Discovery stores all its state. Plain files; commit it to git if you want. |
| **`dx`** | The Microsoft Discovery CLI. Same SDK as the app, exposed as a command-line tool. |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to try |
| --- | --- |
| **No Microsoft Discovery icon in the Activity Bar** | The extension didn't activate. Restart VS Code. If still missing, reinstall from the installer. |
| **Bookshelf indexing stays at "Processing"** | Large folders take a few minutes. If it's stuck longer than that, right-click the shelf and choose **Cancel Indexing**, then re-ingest a smaller subset to confirm the provider is healthy. |
| **Copilot doesn't seem to use my Bookshelf** | Check the **checkbox** next to the shelf is ticked — that's what exposes it to Copilot. Reload the VS Code window if you just ticked it. |
| **An Agent Plugin isn't showing up** | Confirm the marketplace URL is in `chat.plugins.marketplaces` in your **user** settings (not workspace settings). Reload VS Code. |
| **An engine won't start** | Open the **Engines** panel, hover the entry for an error tooltip, then run `dx engine routing-snapshot` from a terminal to see what tools are wired up. |
| **`dx` says "no workspace"** | Either pass `--workspace <path>` explicitly, or run `dx init --workspace <path>` once to create the `.discovery/` folder. |
| **LLM-backed commands return warnings instead of answers** | No model route is configured. Run `dx workspace config llm show` to inspect, and `dx workspace config llm set-azure-openai ...` to point at your endpoint. Local embedding still works without this. |
| **Need a deeper diagnostic** | `dx doctor --workspace .` walks every dependency, model route, and provider and tells you exactly what's broken. |
